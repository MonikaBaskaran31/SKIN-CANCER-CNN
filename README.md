Skin Cancer Detection using CNN
This deep learning project focuses on detecting different types of skin cancer using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on dermatoscopic images to classify various skin lesion types and assist in early diagnosis.

Project Overview:
Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers globally. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial. This project builds a CNN model using Keras and TensorFlow to classify skin lesions into one of several cancer categories based on dermatoscopic images.
